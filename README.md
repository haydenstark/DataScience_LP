 Code summary of Data Science Live Project

## Intro
Over the course of two weeks, I worked solo creating various visualizations and analyzing data retrieved from the Google Play Store. For the duration of the live project, I used Jupyter Notebook to code and Power BI to present all findings. Each story is divided into its own folder, containing its code and report which can be viewed there. This project significantly helped my understanding of how and when to use the appropriate stastical analysis, as well as gain more familiarity with seaborn and matplotlib. Most importantly, this project forced me to think for myself and unearth valuable insight as if in a true work environment.

#### Story 124
The largest story and one I spent the most time on. The user story asked for multiple cluster visualizations to display ratings for all categories.

#### Story 120 and 103
Both stories utilized correlation heat maps and one way anovas to discern if categorical variables affected numerical outcomes. Story 120 was my last completion for the live project.

#### Story 121
This story uses linear regression to demonstrate the relationship between two numeric variables.

#### Story 126 and 109
Both stories use correlation to describe the relationship between two numeric variables.

#### Story 111
This was the first story I grabbed while still cleaning and getting used to the data. The user story asked for the mean price range across categories.
